**FreeBonde x TrustChain Hackathon**

A prototype demonstrating how decentralized identity (DID), verifiable credentials (VCs), and secure data flows can enhance trust and transparency in indoor smart farming.


**🌱 What This Demo Does**

- Assigns a DID identity to each FreeBonde indoor farming device

- Generates verifiable growth credentials (plant logs, nutrient records, EC/pH data)

- Enables users to own their farming data

- Allows trusted data transfer for marketplaces, DAO incentives, and community farming networks
  

**🔗 Powered by TrustChain**

- This project integrates TrustChain building blocks for:

- Decentralized identity

- Interoperable verifiable credentials

- Secure, privacy-preserving data exchange
  

**🚧 Status**

Early-stage prototype built specifically for the TrustChain Hackathon.
