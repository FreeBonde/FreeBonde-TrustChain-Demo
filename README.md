# 🚀 TrustChain Hackathon Submission
This repository contains the prototype developed for the NGI TrustChain Hackathon (Nov 2025).

# FreeBonde x TrustChain Hackathon

A prototype demonstrating how decentralized identity (DID), verifiable credentials (VCs), and secure data flows can enhance trust and transparency in indoor smart farming.


## 🌱 What This Demo Does

- Assigns a DID identity to each FreeBonde indoor farming device

- Generates verifiable growth credentials (plant logs, nutrient records, EC/pH data)

- Enables users to own their farming data

- Allows trusted data transfer for marketplaces, DAO incentives, and community farming networks
  

## 🔗 Powered by TrustChain

- This project integrates TrustChain building blocks for:

- Decentralized identity

- Interoperable verifiable credentials

- Secure, privacy-preserving data exchange
  

## 🚧 Status

Early-stage prototype built specifically for the TrustChain Hackathon.


## Why This Matters
Centralized agriculture creates dependency and vulnerability. FreeBonde enables:
- Household food resilience  
- Trustworthy IoT operations  
- Transparent supply chains  
- Community-driven micro-production  

## Tech Stack
- IoT microcontroller + sensors  
- AI microservices for automation  
- Decentralized identity (DID)  
- Encrypted data sharing  
- React / Flutter app (optional)
